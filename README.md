# wfq_simulator
Simulation of WFQ network scheduling algorithm.

## General info
![schema](schema.png) <br>
The goal of this project is to model a Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) system for two sources of packet inflow. <br>
The first is an inflow with Poisson distribution with constant or exponential packet size. <br>
The second is a constant bit rate (CBR) inflow with a fixed packet size. <br>

For the traffic generated by the above sources, the following measurement metrics will be simulation calculated:
* average number of packets in the queue,
* average queue time,
* average server load.

In order to perform the simulation, a simulation model was be built and then implemented. <br>
Please contact me to get more documentation for this project.<br>

Project was made as a part of 'Experimentally Driven Research in Computer Networks' ('Eksperymenty w teleinformatycznych sieciach badawczych') course at Warsaw University of Technology.
